# RSSI_Indoor

This repo contains source code of an application created using android studio, and it basically reads and records the RSSI signals of nearby wifi spots, and saves them in a csv format, it's main intention is to gather data to teach machine learning algorithms to be able to determine one's location using only the information from nearby wifi spots. The application uses the Chaquopy SDK to be able to use python in the application which makes the implementation of tables(csv) much easier
